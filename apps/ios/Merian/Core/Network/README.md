# Core Network

This directory owns Merian's authenticated, certificate-pinned foreground
network client. Durable background uploads and replay scheduling live under
`Core/Data/OfflineSync`.

## Environment selection

`SupabaseManager` is initialized from the typed `MerianEnvironment`
configuration. Missing or invalid Supabase values keep app startup non-crashing
but block real endpoint construction. A Debug simulator that resolves to the
known production Supabase host is different: the configuration remains valid,
and the app logs a conspicuous production-use diagnostic while auth, reads, and
writes continue.

Use matching local/staging URL and client-key overrides in ignored
`Config.local.xcconfig` for routine simulator work. For a deliberate production
smoke test, the Xcode Run environment variable
`MERIAN_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_IN_DEBUG_SIMULATOR=1` suppresses only the
diagnostic. It does not redirect traffic, isolate rows, or prevent a cleared
session from creating an anonymous production user.

## `MerianNetworkClient`

- Builds authenticated requests to Supabase Edge Functions and retains the
  existing response/request DTO contracts.
- Rejects an existing but zero-byte foreground playback-video file before
  requesting an upload signature, matching the durable queue and Edge
  positive-size contract.
- Uses one pinned `URLSession` for both inference and connection prewarming.
  `prewarmInferenceEndpoint()` sends `OPTIONS` to `/identify-multimodal`; an
  auth SDK request is not considered a prewarm because it uses another
  connection pool.
- Adds `X-Merian-Constrained-Network` for aggregate diagnostics without exposing
  the active interface or user identity.
- Reads privacy-safe `Server-Timing` and `X-Merian-Edge-Region` response
  headers.
- Records URLSession request-upload, time-to-first-byte-after-upload, and
  response-transfer intervals.
- Treats current `/identify-multimodal` `200` as a server durability fence:
  moderation, required media promotion, primary species resolution, scan
  creation, and owner-scoped read-back have completed.
- Builds `OwnedScanRecoveryPayload` only from an owned local record. Single
  `/check-scan-status` can repair eligible non-media state; record-based Explore
  sharing and Ask the Community first resolve and byte-validate a complete
  surviving local-media restore plan, then repair status, and only then request
  signing URLs and upload. They refuse owner-row reconstruction when no
  observation media survives. Field Chat may repair non-media status because it
  does not publish media. Explore can then combine the repaired row with
  owner-staged local image/video/audio; guarded inline repair remains compatible
  with an older released client that stages before Share. Recovery admits only a
  completed-but-missing job or exact authenticated-owner `replay_exhausted`
  reason, or `media_reconciliation_abandoned` with the matching composite
  dead-letter/quota/media-lifecycle proof. Active, retryable, current/later
  policy, unproven abandonment, deletion, foreign, no-ledger, and unknown state
  fails closed. Restore signing uses the explicit `scan_share_restore` purpose
  and deterministic scan/category filenames, so a completed ingestion can stage
  surviving local media only after an unrestricted scan read confirms the active
  JWT-owned row or proves it absent for guarded reconstruction; tombstoned and
  foreign rows fail closed. Bulk status never mutates server state.
- Treats `failed_retryable` status as a two-step durable transition rather than
  permanent server ownership. The first observation schedules one
  generation-fenced retry. Its exact `server_retryable_failure` marker and
  attempt count are mirrored across the queued scan and durable job and survive
  required re-upload. Fresh reads consult both copies, counters use their
  monotonic maximum, and serialized transitions repair drift before mutation.
  After the persisted delay, only that marker lets the next preflight send
  Identify. A cloud-complete marker has higher authority and can never be
  replaced by retry state.
- Translates known technical Explore failures at the UI boundary so database
  authorization and missing-row implementation detail are not customer-facing.
- Decodes Explore media-health incidents from the canonical `{data:[...]}`
  envelope and one exact direct-array compatibility shape retained defensively.
  An empty `[]` is therefore a valid no-incidents result instead of a Scan
  Library decode error; retained traces do not prove that this shape was
  deployed, and any other malformed success shape becomes
  `MerianError.invalidResponse`. Scan Library coalesces rapid queue-event
  refreshes of this independent read-only endpoint, preserves one trailing
  refresh requested during an in-flight call, and revalidates the authenticated
  owner before projecting the private incident queue.
- Requires `/delete-scan` to return a decodable `success: true` envelope before
  confirming cloud erasure. A missing, false, malformed, or contradictory 2xx
  response is `MerianError.invalidResponse`; the durable
  `PendingCloudDeletionTask` remains queued because auth or response failure is
  never evidence that remote data is absent. Its capped-backoff retries do not
  expire; the next drain repairs legacy paused job state while the backend
  independently resumes any owner-bound tombstone it already accepted.

## Field trip completion evidence

Catalog and template-detail checklist items may decode an optional private
`completed_scan_id` into `FieldTripChecklistItem.completedScanId`. The ID is the
exact saved scan that completed that item; clients must not infer completed
slots from `completed_count` or array order. The API supplies no media URL.
Explore resolves the identifier against the current device's `LocalScanRecord`
library and reuses `ScanThumbnail`/Insight navigation when available.

The backing catalog/detail RPCs are service-role-only. iOS reaches them through
the authenticated `/field-trips` Edge Function, which supplies the verified
caller ID. Never add this field to public Field trip profiles, publication or
challenge DTOs, Explore feed/map DTOs, or the capture-context DTO.

Template detail additionally decodes optional `FieldTripProgress.publicationId`
/ `publishedAt`. These fields refer only to the requesting owner's active,
non-deleted outing publication. The title badge derives Published from a
non-null publication ID; completion and Community results are not substitutes.
Missing fields remain backward-compatible and render Private during a staged
backend/client rollout.

## Field trip scan progress

`applyFieldTripProgress(scanId:preferredGoal:)` posts
`{"action":"apply_scan_progress","scan_id":"..."}` and may add an optional
`preferred_goal` object containing `user_field_trip_id` and `item_id`. The hint
is best effort and server-validated; older callers omit it. Eligible Capture
submissions also include the same object in the identification-ingestion
payload, allowing the scan-insert trigger to apply progress atomically. The
later Field trips call repeats the hint and retrieves the authoritative receipt
rather than creating a second mutation.

An unreviewed identification earns automatic credit only at the applicable
Possible-match boundary (`Flash >= 0.75`, `Pro >= 0.65`). A weaker result keeps
the preference pending until explicit confirmation or a confirmed
correction/community resolution. A later confidence, inference-tier, or
confirmation downgrade can remove that scan's credit and reopen completed
progress.

The client decodes standard updates from `data` plus Seasonal Challenge updates
from `challenge_updates`. Both update models optionally decode
`creditedLevelNumber`, `creditedLevelTitle`, `creditedCompletedCount`, and
`creditedTargetCount`, plus removed-item metadata used when an identification or
evidence correction invalidates credit. These fields describe the level changed
by the scan; when a completion advances immediately, current counts describe the
next level while credited counts preserve the just-completed full ring. Toast
accessors fall back to current counts against the legacy response shape.

Only updates with nonempty `newlyCompletedItems` represent a new credit. The
first item is in server checklist order and supplies the toast label/focus
target, with its prompt as the common-name fallback. Reapplying an already
credited scan is idempotent and yields no progress toast. Weak pending receipts
and downgrade reconciliation also return no newly completed items and must not
produce a progress toast.

`getFieldTripScanContributions(scanId:)` posts
`{"action":"scan_contributions","scan_id":"..."}` and decodes one
`FieldTripScanContribution` per credited standard outing or Event. The DTO
contains only source IDs, labels, credited item/level counts, artwork inputs,
and typed-routing inputs. It must never grow media, coordinates, notes, or
public evidence. The Insight view model silently treats empty and failed reads
as no card.

## Field trip capture context

`getFieldTripCaptureContext()` posts `{"action":"capture_context"}` to the
authenticated `/field-trips` Edge Function and decodes the narrow
`FieldTripCaptureContextResponse`. The response contains standard field
trip/current level metadata, aggregate progress, and unfinished target prompts
only. It must not contain scan evidence, media, location, or field notes.

`MerianNetworkClient` performs the request. `FieldTripCaptureGoalProvider` maps
the source DTOs into a generic `CaptureGoalContextSnapshot`. After a successful
empty response it uses the existing authenticated `template_detail` slug lookup
to validate the optional Backyard Safari introduction. No database or Edge
contract changes are required. `ActiveCaptureGoalStore` owns the five-minute
freshness policy, per-account cache, selected-goal persistence, and silent
stale-data retention. Concurrent freshness checks share the provider request; an
explicit invalidation received while that request is active queues at most one
forced follow-up. Capture never imports these Field trip DTOs. Callers must
never await this request before starting the camera or accepting a capture. See
`docs/backend-and-data/05-api-contracts.md` and
`docs/features-and-hardware/25-field-trips.md`. The source-agnostic ownership
decision and future provider aggregation rules live in
`docs/rfcs/active-capture-goal-context.md`.

## Request-Body Completion

`performAuthenticatedRequest` accepts an optional, idempotent body-upload-
complete callback. `MerianRequestUploadDelegate` fires it from
`urlSession(_:task:didSendBodyData:...)` when all expected bytes have been sent.
Receiving the response is the fallback for protocols that do not deliver upload
progress; a transport failure fires it immediately.

For eligible live-camera still-image analysis this callback releases the durable
queue row for background upload after the inline body no longer competes for
uplink capacity. The caller also installs a two-second fail-safe. Connectivity
loss and app backgrounding release ownership through `OfflineQueueManager`
directly.

## Deferred Context

`updateScanContext` sends owner-authenticated late WeatherKit/geocoding data to
`/update-scan-context`, keyed by `scan_id`. It carries only supported optional
elevation, weather, and semantic-location fields and never resubmits media or
starts another identification.

## Failure Rules

Authentication failures propagate to callers; they are not converted to missing
headers. TLS pin failures, invalid HTTPS URLs, and response validation failures
remain fail-closed. Upload-completion callbacks release queue ownership on
failure, but they do not delete the durable row; the existing live-success path
alone performs queue cleanup and task cancellation.

Transport failures and returned `5xx` responses are ambiguous: the server may
have committed before the connection failed. Foreground replay is therefore
limited to the audited read-route inventory and exact endpoint contracts that
receive a server-supported idempotency key. New routes default to no ambiguous
replay. Insert-only comments/feedback/flags, toggle actions, and multi-action
Field trip requests never gain replay merely because they use `POST`. Signed
upload-session and upload-URL preparation remains excluded from the generic
foreground request replay inventory because avatar and legacy signing requests
do not have a stable scan registration identity. Structured scan signing with
`clientScanId` is database-idempotent on owner/scan/object key, but its durable
retry is owned explicitly by `OfflineQueueManager`; do not turn that guarantee
into blanket replay for every signer caller.

Every retry delay is cancellation-propagating. A task canceled while waiting for
transport, server, route-propagation, or guest-session retry exits with
`CancellationError` before constructing another request. Do not replace these
awaits with `try?`: URLSession cancellation is cooperative, and swallowing the
sleep error would let stale inference work replay after ownership moved to a
newer generation. Foundation may surface its async URLSession bridge as
`NSURLErrorCancelled`; the shared request boundary normalizes that error to
`CancellationError` only when the enclosing Swift task is canceled. Session
invalidation or another transport-owned cancellation retains its original
`URLError`.

The Explore replay-cancellation unit regression must observe its first
`MockURLProtocol` dispatch through a bounded monotonic wait before canceling the
task. A fixed executor-yield count is not a URLSession scheduling guarantee on
hosted simulators. Keep both exact request-count assertions: one request before
cancellation and still one afterward, proving the cancellation-propagating retry
delay did not construct a replay.

A Supabase platform `404 NOT_FOUND` is not an application-level missing record.
`performAuthenticatedRequest` classifies it only when the fixed
`X-Merian-Handler: 1` response marker is absent and the response contains the
stable `SB-Error-Code: NOT_FOUND` header, official missing-function envelope, or
equivalent gateway-without-execution headers. It then replays the same request
after one-, two-, and four-second delays. The handler did not execute, so replay
is safe; request bodies and idempotency keys remain unchanged. A marked
handler-owned `404`, including `Scan not found`, is never route-retried and
remains eligible for the normal owner-row recovery flow. Exhausted platform
route retries become `MerianError.edgeFunctionUnavailable`, so downstream
missing-record logic cannot mark the scan unavailable. Customer surfaces use
temporary-availability copy rather than exposing Supabase router text.

Background `/identify-multimodal` downloads retain the same selected response
headers and run this classifier before general HTTP handling. A platform route
`404` preserves the queued scan and schedules its normal durable retry. A queued
handler `401`, `408`, `409`, `425`, or `429` is also retryable because a fresh
request can refresh authentication, recover an already-finalized result, or
honor transient capacity. Integer `Retry-After` values are bounded by the
queue's maximum delay. Other handler-owned `4xx` responses preserve the local
media as `queueNeedsAttention`; only the exact stable `observation_rejected`
policy response is terminal.

An HTTP `200` is only a candidate background success. Its body must be nonempty,
decode as the generated Identify envelope, not explicitly report
`success: false`, contain a nonempty bounded scan ID, and contain a finite
confidence score from zero through one before local finalization starts. Empty,
truncated, or structurally unusable bodies are ambiguous transport outcomes and
enter exact-ID status recovery plus the durable retry path. The queue row is
removed and its job is marked complete only after response persistence and the
main-context queue deletion both commit. Wrong-scan envelopes, local save
failures, and cleanup save failures retain the queue instead of converting a
no-op save into data loss. A valid confidence-zero envelope for the exact scan
remains terminal and intentionally creates no `LocalScanRecord`, but its source
media stays intact until the main-context queue deletion commits and authorizes
file cleanup. The guarded deletion marks the job complete, inserts the completed
event, and removes the row in the same save; only explicit deletion records
cancellation.

Foreground Identify handling does not translate every `409` into a network
timeout. Only handler responses whose stable code is exactly
`ai_request_in_progress`, `ai_request_already_completed`,
`scan_already_complete`, or `scan_already_finalized` enter the **Restoring
scan** state and remain eligible for exact-ID queue/status hydration. Generic
conflicts, malformed envelopes, and `409` responses from other routes keep their
normal error semantics. Current functions should normally absorb these four
cases and replay `200`; the client branch is a rolling-deployment and
unexpected-race safety net.

Owner-row repair is not a fallback table upsert. The server derives owner
identity, validates/gates recovery, inserts without overwrite, reloads by owner,
and restores media only through validated staging keys. A processing/retryable
or exact policy-rejected job remains unrepaired.

Scan-status success is also treated as untrusted input. Single responses must
decode to the reviewed enum, may echo only the exact requested scan ID, and
cannot report a negative job-attempt count. A bulk response must contain exactly
one unique row for every requested scan ID and no foreign row. Duplicate,
missing, malformed, foreign, or negative-attempt rows become
`MerianError.invalidResponse`; bulk decoding never uses
`Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:)`, whose duplicate-key precondition would
otherwise let a contradictory server response terminate the app.

Before Field Chat presentation,
`ensureCloudScanAvailableForFieldChat(scan:expectedScanId:)` first requires the
local record to match the engine result that will be presented, then polls the
exact owner status and uses bounded non-media recovery only for eligible
historical drift. Explore sharing can combine the same bounded owner recovery
with newly signed local user media. Both retain the stable scan UUID, reject a
stale record/engine identity combination, and keep transient/unknown state
retryable. A handler-owned missing scan is classified by stable
`code: "not_found"`; case-insensitive `Scan not found` text remains only a
released-backend compatibility fallback when no stable code is present. The
joined contract is
[`docs/backend-and-data/16-scan-ingestion-reliability-and-recovery.md`](../../../../../docs/backend-and-data/16-scan-ingestion-reliability-and-recovery.md).

An HTTP-successful Explore-share response is not accepted on decoding alone.
`shareScanToExplore` requires `success: true`, the exact requested scan UUID, a
valid post UUID, a parseable ISO-8601 share timestamp, an authoritative
location-sharing value that equals an explicitly requested privacy mode, and an
explicit `published` publication status. Unknown location values are rejected
instead of being coerced into success. Any integrity mismatch becomes
`MerianError.invalidResponse`; callers must not cache the post ID or dismiss the
composer as though publication succeeded.

Ask the Community applies the same candidate-success rule: decoder failures,
unknown request statuses, false success flags, identity mismatches, invalid
UUIDs/timestamps, or non-`needs_id` results become
`MerianError.invalidResponse`.

Field Chat responses are decoded through one strict path for both Insight scans
and Explore posts. Every envelope must echo the requested scan/post through
`subject_id`, including when the thread is empty. Every message must have a
unique UUID, match that same subject through `scan_id`, match the envelope's
valid conversation UUID, contain trimmed/nonempty text bounded to 4,000
characters, and fit the exact v1 server limits. Field Chat JSON is rejected
above the reviewed 1 MiB decode ceiling. A send response must also contain
exactly one user message and one assistant message carrying the requested
`client_message_id`, and the acknowledged user row must contain the exact
trimmed text that was sent. Invalid, contradictory, or incomplete envelopes
never reach `InsightChatViewModel.apply`; failed sends remain retryable under
the same canonical lowercase idempotency UUID rather than clearing the pending
question or creating a duplicate on manual retry. A backend
`field_chat_idempotency_conflict` means that UUID was reused for edited text and
is never treated as confirmation of either send.

Atomic admission and stale-request recovery remain backend authority.
`field_chat_send_in_progress`, `field_chat_admission_unavailable`, and
`field_chat_recovery_unavailable` are temporary failures; network/UI callers
must preserve the exact pending UUID and text. The client never infers database
capacity, daily eligibility, or the ten-minute stale-recovery condition from a
local count or timeout.

Feedback, feature-feedback, field-note-summary, and prompt-suggestion responses
also require the exact subject echo plus confirmed action-specific evidence.
False `ok` values, mismatched message/rating/sentiment fields, invalid IDs,
empty or UUID-leaking summaries, and duplicate, oversized, unknown-category, or
locally unsafe prompts become `MerianError.invalidResponse`; no success UI is
applied.

## Sign-out transition

`SupabaseManager` closes the authenticated-request gate and clears observable
account state before asking Supabase Auth to invalidate the local session. It
cancels its ghost-session and public-author refresh tasks first, ignores late
authenticated SDK events while sign-out is active, and serializes concurrent
sign-out callers through one task. `getValidAuthHeaders()` fails closed during
that interval, checking both before and after asynchronous token retrieval, and
session-refresh retries cannot reopen authenticated state. Explore, Field trip,
and profile Edge requests therefore cannot launch with a token that is being
invalidated.

Call `transitionToGhostSession()` for user-facing sign-out or anonymous-session
recovery. It creates the replacement guest identity only after sign-out and
external identity cleanup finish. Account deletion intentionally calls
`signOut()` alone so it does not recreate an identity during deletion. The
`/safe-delete` call may return immediate `200` completion or `202` durable
acceptance; the shared request layer treats either 2xx response as success.
Backend intent and relational cleanup are persisted before the client signs out.
The scheduled account-deletion reaper owns cursor-persisted R2 sweeps, delayed
empty verification, and terminal Auth removal; a new request therefore normally
receives `202`.
