## Optimize RLS Policies for Performance

Poorly written RLS policies can cause severe performance issues. Use subqueries and indexes strategically.

**Incorrect (function called for every row):**

```sql
create policy orders_policy on orders
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);  -- auth.uid() called per row!

-- With 1M rows, auth.uid() is called 1M times
```

**Correct (wrap functions in SELECT):**

```sql
create policy orders_policy on orders
  using ((select auth.uid()) = user_id);  -- Called once, cached

-- 100x+ faster on large tables
```

Use security definer functions for complex checks only when their privilege
boundary is reviewed:

`SECURITY DEFINER` functions run with the creator's privileges and can bypass
RLS on referenced tables. Keep them in a non-exposed schema, fix the
`search_path`, fully qualify objects, and revoke `EXECUTE` from every unintended
role. Authorize the actual caller inside the function: use `auth.uid()` for a
user-bound helper, but use an explicit service-role, admin, worker, capability,
or reservation check for a service-only routine. A blanket `auth.uid()` rule is
incorrect for callers that intentionally have no end-user JWT.

```sql
-- Create helper function in a private schema
create or replace function private.is_team_member(team_id bigint)
returns boolean
language sql
security definer
set search_path = ''
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1 from public.team_members
    -- always check the calling user's identity inside the function
    where team_id = $1 and user_id = (select auth.uid())
  );
$$;

-- Revoke direct execution from public roles
revoke execute on function private.is_team_member(bigint) from PUBLIC, anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- Use in policy (indexed lookup, not per-row check)
create policy team_orders_policy on orders
  using ((select private.is_team_member(team_id)));
```

Always add indexes on columns used in RLS policies:

```sql
create index orders_user_id_idx on orders (user_id);
```
