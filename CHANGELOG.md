## Unreleased

### Added

- Added the initial Next.js + Mantine web app scaffold for public Explore share pages.
- Added public Terms, Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, Privacy Choices, Support, and Legal hub pages for `merian.earth`.
- Added an iOS-to-web theme bridge so Merian-opened web pages can follow the app's theme preference.
- Added AI-derived sex observation metadata to scan records, the Overview card, Supabase persistence, and Darwin Core exports.
- Added native Messages and Photos share extensions: Messages can insert cached scan images/cards/descriptions, and Photos can queue one shared image for Merian identification.

### Fixed

- Fixed capture bottom controls getting hidden by stale keyboard state after leaving Describe or canceling staged input.
- Fixed field notes dictation startup and kept the loading spinner from shifting the button label.
- Fixed Explore map count text so exactly one visible item says "1 discovery in view."
- Fixed audio insight carousel swiping when reference images load after the audio page is already visible.
